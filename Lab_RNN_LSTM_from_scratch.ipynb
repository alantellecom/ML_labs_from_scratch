But what do we do if we're modelling data with strong dependency in both directions? Like in many things deep learning, we can build powerful models by stacking layers on top of each other: *bi-directional* RNNs consist of two LSTM cells, one for each direction. A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell.
